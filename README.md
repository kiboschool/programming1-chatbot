# Squad Info Bot: Instructions

Together with your squad, write a chatbot program that answers with information about your squad interactively.

## Your Task

The chat bot program should welcome the user, then prompt them with different options. Depending on the option they choose, your program should print out information about your squad.

Store squad member info in lists. Use a combination of loops, list access, and conditional statements to display the information requested by the user.

Your chatbot should handle bad inputs gracefully. If the user types in a word when the program wants a number, or enters a number that's out of range, the program should not crash. In the same vein, if you are using names, the bot should work with both uppercase and lowercase names.

## Expected Results

Here's a sample of a working chatbot by the Kibo Team:

### What info should you use?

You have to have multiple options for what info to display, but they can be anything.
- names (first name, last initial)
- bio
- superpower
- home country
- favorite things

Your bot can also have other features!
- tell a joke or riddle
- say random phrases
- share a poem

There are lots of fun things you can add to your bot.

## Rubric

The bot should be a project that all the teammates contribute to, so it should have info about each squadmate.

- [ ] Info is stored in a list
- [ ] Program uses a loop to repeat questions and answers
- [ ] Program accesses list to show different info depending on what the user enters

## More Ideas

Be creative! As long as your bot has info about your squad, you can add anything else that you like.

* Find an ASCII art logo, or use a generator to make one
* Use the [Python termcolor module](https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/) to show your output in color
